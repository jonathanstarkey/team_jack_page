                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">The Battle Against Pediatric Brain Cancer</h2>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Pediatric brain cancer is currently the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths.  Nearly 30% of children diagnosed with brain cancer will pass, while many survivors will be left with lifelong disabilities.
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Pediatric cancer in general is underfunded (attaining a mere 4% of the National Cancer Institute’s funding), with only 5% of that NCI sum dedicated to brain cancer research (despite being the deadliest childhood cancer with possible long-term side effects!).
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Most research funding comes from non-profit organizations like the Team Jack Foundation.  This funding is crucial to help combat the disease and explore treatment options, from identifying genetic mutations through building “smart drugs” and immunotherapy treatments.  Team Jack works closely with a scientific advisory board to identify and explore the best treatment options to pursue with funding.

                    <h2 style="margin-bottom:0;">The Battle Against Pediatric Brain Cancer</h2>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Our mission at Fat Brain Toys has always been to design and curate quality, mind-expanding, open-ended toys that educate and provide long-term benefits through play.  A “fat brain” is a happy brain!
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">On the one hand, pediatric brain cancer can negatively impact or destroy a child’s ability to love, speak, see, run, balance, create, and laugh. On the other hand, Fat Brain Toys’ goal to provide “A Smarter Way to Play” seeks to strengthen a child’s abilities in verbal skills, visual acuity, balance, sensory discernment, nurturing, creating, building, and problem-solving. 
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">These are the skills and foundations of your personality, and tumors that strike this still-maturing organ can be devastating.  Any disease that compromises a child’s ability to grow, learn, and live impacts us deeply.  And so, partnering with the Team Jack Foundation to help defeat pediatric brain cancer was a logical choice for us. 
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">Our company and our employees have taken this important cause to heart, and we hope you decide to join Team Jack.

                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">The Team Jack Foundation is comprised of hardworking Team members directly impacted by the disease and committed to fighting it.
</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">The foundation was formed in Atkinson, Nebraska, during Jack Hoffman’s battle against cancer.  Initially diagnosed at the age of six in 2011, Jack has undergone two life-threatening surgeries, chemotherapy, remission, relapse, and immunotherapy.  His family started the foundation so that, while he continues to fight, Team Jack continues to raise funds for research.
